#Â SpaceName

SpaceName lets you show and quickly edit macOS space names in your menubar. It uses the API provided by [TotalSpaces2](http://totalspaces.binaryage.com), so you'll need a licensed copy of that installed for SpaceName to work.

Double-click the space name to edit and hit enter when you're done.

Currently, you've got to build SpaceName yourself using Xcode.

## Build

Install dependencies with [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

```bash
carthage update
```

Build SpaceName

```bash
xcodebuild
```
